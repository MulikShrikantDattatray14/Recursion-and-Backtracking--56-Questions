Problem Description :

Given the total number of person A and a number B which indicates that B-1 persons are skipped and the Bth person is killed in a circle. Find the last person standing in the circle. As an example, for A = 12, and B = 2,


Problem Constraints : 
1 <= A <= 104
2 <= B <= A



Input Format :

First argument A is an integer.
Second argument B is an integer.


Output Format:
Return an integer.


Example Input:
Input 1:
A = 4
B = 2
Input 2:
A = 5
B = 3


Example Output:
Output 1:
1
Output 2:
4


Example Explanation :
For Input 1:
Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed,
then the person at position 3 is killed. So the person at position 1 survives. 
For Input 2:
Firstly, the person at position 3, then the person at position 1 is killed, 
then the person at position 5 is killed. Finally, the person at position 2 is killed. 
So the person at position 4 survives.

solution approach:-

After the first person (B-th from the beginning) is killed, 
A-1 persons are left. So we call Josephus(A – 1, B) to get the 
position with A-1 persons. But the position returned by 
Josephus(A – 1, B) will consider the position starting from B%A + 1. 
So, we must make adjustments to the position returned by Josephus(A – 1, B). 

Time Complexity : O(A)
Space Complexity : O(A)

================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

let A = 5
let B = 3 // ans=4
let ans = josephus(A, B);
console.log(ans)
function josephus(n, k) {

  if (n == 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return (((josephus(n - 1, k) + k - 1) % n) + 1);
}

Note :-

1. After the first person (B-th from the beginning) is killed, 
A-1 persons are left. So we call Josephus(A – 1, B) to get the 
position with A-1 persons. But the position returned by 
Josephus(A – 1, B) will consider the position starting from B%A + 1. 
So, we must make adjustments to the position returned by Josephus(A – 1, B). 

2. we will add k-1 , as the starting position as been shifted by k-1.

3. we are using %n , bcz we are dealing with the circle 

4. +1 is the adjustment.
